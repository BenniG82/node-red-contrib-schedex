# node-red-contrib-schedex

Scheduler for node-red which allows you to enter on/off times as 24hr clock (e.g. 01:10) or suncalc events (e.g. goldenHour).

Inspired by Pete Scargill's [BigTimer](http://tech.scargill.net/big-timer/)

TODO: 
 - [x] Fuzzy on and off times (e.g. turn my light on at a random time each day within +-60 minutes of goldenHour).
 - [ ] Initial scheduling should show off or on next, depending on which is next.
